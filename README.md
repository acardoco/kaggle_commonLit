# kaggle_commonLit

Earned my first silver medal on Kaggle! My solution combined a DeBERTaV3-large model with additional smaller models (RoBERTa, DeBERTaV3-base) and utilized Optuna for hyperparameter optimization. I also integrated an ensemble of XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM models with a 4-fold cross-validation approach.
